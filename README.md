2.  **Replace Images:** Add your own images (logo, project screenshots, profile picture) to the `src/Images` folder. Then, update the `import` statements at the top of the relevant components to point to your new images.
3.  **Change Styles:** All styles are located in `.css` files that correspond to each component. Feel free to modify colors, fonts, and spacing to match your personal brand.
